Email AI Assistant

What's This?

So, this is a simple but cool email assistant that helps you deal with your emails automatically. It checks your inbox, reads emails, analyzes them (sentiment-wise), gives you a summary, and even replies if it's urgent or positive. It also handles attachments and can organize them into folders. It's powered by AI, so it gets smarter as you use it.

Features

Fetch Emails: It grabs unread emails from your inbox, so you don't have to.

Summarize Emails: The AI reads the emails and gives you a quick summary + a reply suggestion.

Sentiment Check: It checks the mood of the email, like if it's positive, negative, or just neutral. Helps prioritize.

Email Categories: It automatically tags emails as work, personal, or spam based on keywords. So cool, right?

Attachment Handling: It downloads and saves attachments into a folder for later use.

Automatic Reply: If the email is urgent or nice, it automatically replies with a thank-you and a quick response.
